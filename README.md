# tutorial-dask-future

Tutorial on flexible parallelization in Python using Dask and in R using future.

The Dask package in Python and the future package in R provide new flexible approaches for doing parallel computation, both on single machines and for distributed parallelization across multiple machines.

[This tutorial is under construction and should be finished as of March 11, 2019.]

Please see the [`overview.html`](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/berkeley-scf/tutorial-dask-future/blob/master/overview.html) file to get started. It links to the Python Dask material in [`python-dask.html`](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/berkeley-scf/tutorial-dask-future/blob/master/python-dask.html) and the R future material in [`R-future.html`](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/berkeley-scf/tutorial-dask-future/blob/master/R-future.html).
