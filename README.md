# tutorial-dask-future

Tutorial on flexible parallelization in Python using Dask and in R using future.

The Dask package in Python and the future package in R provide new flexible approaches for doing parallel computation, both on single machines and for distributed parallelization across multiple machines.

[This tutorial is under construction and should be finished as of March 11, 2019.]

Please see the `overview.html` file to get started. It links to the Python Dask material in `python-dask.html` and the R future material in `R-future.html`.
